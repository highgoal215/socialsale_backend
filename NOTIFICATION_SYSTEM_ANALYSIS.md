# Notification System Analysis

## Overview
The auto notification system for order status changes and successful payments is implemented but may have some issues preventing notifications from working properly. This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the system.

## System Components

### 1. Backend Notification System

#### Notification Model (`models/Notification.js`)
- ✅ Properly structured with all required fields
- ✅ Supports different notification types: `order_update`, `payment`, `support`, `promo`, `system`
- ✅ Includes real-time WebSocket support via `relatedId` and `onModel` fields

#### Notification Preferences (`models/NotificationPreference.js`)
- ✅ User preferences for different notification types
- ✅ Quiet hours support
- ✅ Rate limiting (max 10 notifications per hour per user)

#### Notification Controller (`controllers/notifications.js`)
- ✅ `createNotification()` function with preference checking
- ✅ `createSystemNotification()` function that bypasses preferences
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket emission via `global.io`
- ✅ Rate limiting and quiet hours enforcement

### 2. Order Status Change Notifications

#### Order Creation (`controllers/orders.js`)
- ✅ Creates notification when new order is created
- ✅ Proper notification type: `order_update`

#### Order Processing (`controllers/orders.js`)
- ✅ Creates notification when order status changes to "processing"
- ✅ Creates notification when order is sent to supplier
- ✅ Creates notification if order processing fails

#### Supplier Webhook (`controllers/orders.js`)
- ✅ Handles supplier status updates via webhook
- ✅ Creates notifications for all status changes:
  - `completed` → "Order Completed"
  - `partial` → "Order Partially Completed"
  - `canceled` → "Order Canceled"
  - `failed` → "Order Failed"
  - `processing` → "Order Processing"

#### Manual Status Updates (`controllers/orders.js`)
- ✅ Admin can manually update order status
- ✅ Creates notification for manual status changes

### 3. Payment Notifications

#### Payment Webhook (`controllers/payments.js`)
- ✅ Handles Checkout.com webhook events
- ✅ Creates notification for successful payments (`payment_approved`, `payment_captured`)
- ✅ Creates notification for failed payments (`payment_declined`, `payment_failed`)
- ✅ Proper notification type: `payment`

### 4. Frontend Notification System

#### Notification Context (`context/NotificationContext.tsx`)
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket connection
- ✅ Automatic notification fetching
- ✅ Toast notifications for new notifications
- ✅ Proper authentication checks

#### Socket Service (`services/socket-service.ts`)
- ✅ WebSocket connection management
- ✅ User room joining for real-time notifications
- ✅ Admin room joining

#### Notification Panel (`components/NotificationPanel.tsx`)
- ✅ Displays notifications with proper icons
- ✅ Mark as read functionality
- ✅ Delete notification functionality

## Potential Issues and Fixes

### 1. Notification Preference Mapping (FIXED)
**Issue**: The notification preference checking was using incorrect field mapping.
**Fix**: Updated `createNotification()` to properly map notification types to preference fields:
```javascript
const typeToPreferenceMap = {
  'order_update': 'orderUpdates',
  'payment': 'payments',
  'support': 'support',
  'promo': 'promotions',
  'system': 'system'
};
```

### 2. WebSocket Connection Issues
**Potential Issue**: WebSocket connection might not be established properly.
**Check**: Ensure the backend server is running and WebSocket is properly configured.

### 3. User Authentication Issues
**Potential Issue**: Frontend might not be properly authenticated.
**Check**: Verify that `admin_token` and `admin_user` are properly stored in localStorage.

### 4. Notification Preferences Blocking Notifications
**Potential Issue**: User preferences might be blocking notifications.
**Check**: Verify that notification preferences are properly set for the user.

## Testing the System

### 1. Run the Test Script
```bash
cd likesio-backend
node test-notification-system.js
```

This will test:
- ✅ Order update notifications
- ✅ Payment notifications
- ✅ System notifications
- ✅ Support notifications
- ✅ Promotional notifications
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Preference blocking

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

#### Test Order Status Changes:
1. Create a new order
2. Check if "New Order Created" notification appears
3. Process the order
4. Check if "Order Processing Started" notification appears
5. Update order status manually
6. Check if status change notification appears

#### Test Payment Notifications:
1. Complete a payment
2. Check if "Payment Successful" notification appears
3. Simulate payment failure
4. Check if "Payment Failed" notification appears

#### Test Real-time Notifications:
1. Open admin panel in browser
2. Check browser console for WebSocket connection
3. Create a notification from another source
4. Verify real-time notification appears

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Backend Logs
Look for these log messages:
- `Notification blocked for user ${userId}: ${type} notifications disabled`
- `Rate limit exceeded for user ${userId}: too many notifications in the last hour`
- `Notification blocked for user ${userId}: quiet hours active`

### 2. Check Frontend Console
Look for:
- WebSocket connection errors
- API request errors
- Authentication errors

### 3. Check Database
Verify notifications are being created:
```javascript
// Check if notifications exist
db.notifications.find({ userId: ObjectId("user_id") })

// Check user preferences
db.notificationpreferences.findOne({ userId: ObjectId("user_id") })
```

### 4. Check WebSocket Connection
In browser console:
```javascript
// Check if socket is connected
socketService.getConnectionStatus()

// Check socket instance
socketService.getSocket()
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. No Notifications Appearing
**Possible Causes**:
- User preferences blocking notifications
- Rate limiting
- Quiet hours active
- WebSocket not connected

**Solutions**:
- Check user notification preferences
- Wait for rate limit to reset
- Disable quiet hours
- Restart frontend application

### 2. Real-time Notifications Not Working
**Possible Causes**:
- WebSocket connection failed
- User not joined to correct room
- Backend server not running

**Solutions**:
- Check WebSocket connection status
- Verify user is authenticated
- Restart backend server

### 3. Notifications Not Being Created
**Possible Causes**:
- `createNotification` function not being called
- User not found
- Database connection issues

**Solutions**:
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify user exists in database
- Check database connection

## Recommendations

### 1. Add More Logging
Add detailed logging to track notification creation:
```javascript
console.log(`Creating notification for user ${userId}: ${type} - ${title}`);
```

### 2. Add Notification Testing Endpoint
Create an admin endpoint to test notifications:
```javascript
// POST /api/notifications/test
exports.testNotification = async (req, res, next) => {
  const { userId, type, title, message } = req.body;
  const notification = await createNotification(userId, type, title, message);
  res.json({ success: true, notification });
};
```

### 3. Add Notification Dashboard
Create a dashboard to monitor notification system health:
- Total notifications created
- Notifications blocked by preferences
- WebSocket connection status
- Rate limiting statistics

### 4. Improve Error Handling
Add better error handling for notification creation failures:
```javascript
try {
  await createNotification(userId, type, title, message);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to create notification:', error);
  // Don't fail the main operation
}
```

## Conclusion

The notification system is well-implemented with proper architecture. The main issue was the preference mapping in the `createNotification` function, which has been fixed. The system should now properly send notifications for:

- ✅ Order status changes (pending → processing → completed/failed)
- ✅ Payment success/failure
- ✅ Manual order status updates
- ✅ Supplier webhook status updates

To ensure the system works properly:
1. Run the test script to verify all components
2. Check user notification preferences
3. Verify WebSocket connections
4. Monitor backend logs for any errors
